# 🚀 Better-CD (b-cd)

> A smarter, faster way to navigate directories in Windows PowerShell using a GUI picker and bookmarks.

**Better-CD** replaces the tedious typing of long paths with a native Windows folder picker and a robust bookmarking system. It features a "Strict Mode" to prevent accidental overwrites of your saved locations.

---

## ✨ Features

- **📂 GUI Navigation:** Just type `b-cd` to open a folder picker and jump instantly.
- **🔖 Smart Bookmarks:** Save your favorite project folders with short names.
- **🛡️ Safety First:** Distinct flags for **New** (`-n`) and **Overwrite** (`-o`) actions prevent accidents.
- **📜 Portable:** Install it anywhere; the script automatically registers the path.
- **☁️ Cloud Friendly:** Configuration is saved in your User Home, keeping your bookmarks safe even if you move the executable.

## 🎮 Usage Guide

### 1. Basic Navigation
Open the folder picker window.
```powershell
b-cd
```

### 2. Jump to a Bookmark
Jump to a saved location immediately.

```powerShell
b-cd project
```

### 3. Create a New Bookmark (-n)
Opens the picker and saves the selected path as "game". Returns an error if "game" already exists.
```powerShell
b-cd -n game
```

### 4. Overwrite a Bookmark (-o)
Updates an existing bookmark with a new path. Returns an error if "game" does not exist (prevents typo creations).
```powerShell
b-cd -o game
```
### 5. ⚡ Instant Mode (CLI Only)
Manage bookmarks quickly without opening the GUI window.

**Create New Bookmark (`-in`)**
```powershell
# Save the CURRENT directory as 'work'
b-cd -in work
```

# Save a SPECIFIC path as 'game'
b-cd -in game "D:\Games\SteamLibrary"
```
Overwrite Existing Bookmark (-io)

```PowerShell

# Update 'work' to point to the CURRENT directory
b-cd -io work

# Update 'game' to point to a new path
b-cd -io game "E:\NewLibrary"
```

### 6. Manage Bookmarks
List all saved bookmarks:
```powerShell
b-cd -list
```
Delete a bookmark:
```powerShell
b-cd -d game
```

### 7. Check Version
```powerShell
b-cd -Version
```
